# Welcome to the About Page
### My name is *Huub*, and I thought it would be good to create a website to document all the ***AMAZING*** things I've done on planet earth.

#### But in all seriousness, this website is mostly for myself as a sort of archive/diary, feel free to get to know me a little (better) by reading along though!
#### There are 5 pages on this website, I'll list them here.    

* [The blog!](/blogmenu/)
    * *Blog posts about random stuff, or just things I'm thinking about.*
* [My portfolio!](/portfoliomenu/)
    * *Page with some stuff I've made, sorted by most recent.*
* [Hobbies!](/hobbiesmenu/)
    * *Games, music, you get the just.*
* [The Wall!](/wall/)
    * *Wall with randomly chosen gifs/images, just for fun.*
* [Links!](/links/)
    * *Links to the many different account I have.*
