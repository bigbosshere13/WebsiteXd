## _**Music:**_

#### **When people ask me what music I listen to, I often don't know what to say,**
#### **partially because my introduction to music was Tiktok, partially because I actually just don't know.**

## But some artists I listen to include (as of January 2025):
* *TV girl, I like their slow but funky beats really. I really liked one of their most recent songs: "Summer 2000 Baby" even though it's way faster than anything they'd usually make.*
* *Alex G, I don't really like his more recent songs because they're more instrumental based, but I liked his old songs which were very lyric focussed, albums like Trick, but I also like DSU.*
* *The Smiths, I like their music, but for me it gets tiring quick, as many of their songs are the same.*
* *Soft rock bands like Nirvana and Weezer, It's a little cringe but it gets the energy in me pumping.*

##### *Here are my top 9 most recently liked songs, I think this is pretty accurate to what I like.

#### I'm currently doing a strategy where I dump a bunch of albums into a playlist, and while listening I remove the songs that I don't like, leaving only a good playlist for me to eat up (yum).
#### So as of writing this you can't get much of the music I like from the "Main" playlist, but that'll change, just patience.

This is starting to look like it could be a part of the blog!
