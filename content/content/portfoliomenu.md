## _Portfolio!_
#### _**(I can't post anything in here yet since I'll do that when I actually create stuff)**_

* ### **Since September of 2024 I've been trying to learn more about programming and computers (or at least try to), since I realised how much free time I really have.**
    * #### *I started with Roblox Studio, which I did for ~2-3 months. I didn't create anything impressive, but it did allow me a gateway into Python.*
    * #### *If you didn't know, Roblox Studio and Python have very similar words, and so it wasn't hard for me to learn in the slightest.*
    * #### *I've come to understand most of base python, and since today I've been delving into the pygame library, which should give me some fun stuff to show.*
