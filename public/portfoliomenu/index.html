(I can&rsquo;t post anything in here yet since I&rsquo;ll do that when I actually create stuff)


Since September of 2024 I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn more about programming and computers (or at least try to), since I realised how much free time I really have.


I started with Roblox Studio, which I did for ~2-3 months. I didn&rsquo;t create anything impressive, but it did allow me a gateway into Python.


If you didn&rsquo;t know, Roblox Studio and Python have very similar words, and so it wasn&rsquo;t hard for me to learn in the slightest.


I&rsquo;ve come to understand most of base python, and since today I&rsquo;ve been delving into the pygame library, which should give me some fun stuff to show.
