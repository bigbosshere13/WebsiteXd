<meta name="description" content="Music:
When people ask me what music I listen to, I often don&rsquo;t know what to say,
partially because my introduction to music was Tiktok, partially because I actually just don&rsquo;t know.
But some artists I listen to include (as of January 2025):

TV girl, I like their slow but funky beats really. I really liked one of their most recent songs: &ldquo;Summer 2000 Baby&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s way faster than anything they&rsquo;d usually make.
Alex G, I don&rsquo;t really like his more recent songs because they&rsquo;re more instrumental based, but I liked his old songs which were very lyric focussed, albums like Trick, but I also like DSU.
The Smiths, I like their music, but for me it gets tiring quick, as many of their songs are the same.
Soft rock bands like Nirvana and Weezer, It&rsquo;s a little cringe but it gets the energy in me pumping.

*Here are my top 9 most recently liked songs, I think this is pretty accurate to what I like.
